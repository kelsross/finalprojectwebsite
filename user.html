    <p>Thank you for choosing Snaptritious for all your nutrition needs! Snaptrition makes all your dietary needs fun and easy to track. Be sure before you start using you sign in through a Google account to help us help you keep track of all your dietary needs. Next, feel free to use any of our three options for retreiving your nutrition information. Snap a picture of a great meal and we will tell you the nutrition behind your food. Or, type in what you're eating. Just make sure you are as specific as possible, including how much you had of a particular food (ex. "one large apple"). Or finally, say it for us and we'll retrieve all the nutrient information you need. Your daily totals are tracked for you in the daily intake button. Happy Snapping!</p>
