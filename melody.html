<p>Week 4/17:What has been done: Created an activity that used Google's Vision API to identify food in picture that the user uploaded. </p>
<p>What needs to be done: Figure out how to start a new activity from the current activity to obtain nutrition facts about the identified food.</p>
<p>Week 4/24: What has been done: I worked with Kelsey to integrate the nutrition information and reverse image search. Now the app allows you to take a photo or import one from your gallery, prompts the user to select the tags that best match the food they ate, input the serving size and the app returns the nutrient information. If the tags somehow do not match what they were eating, the user can opt to input their food manually.</p>
