<p>Week 4/17: What I did: I worked on integrating with the Edamam API over the internet in order to return nutrition facts to the user based on a their query.</p>
  <p>What still needs to be done: I will work on integrating the API I have started utilizing with what Yufeng has been working on in order to return nutrition information to the user based on the tags returned by the image search.</p>
  <p>Week 4/24: What I did: I worked with Yufeng to integrate the nutrition information and reverse image search. Now the app allows you to take a photo or import one from your gallery, prompts the user to select the tags that best match the food they ate, input the serving size and the app returns the nutrient information. If the tags somehow do not match what they were eating, the user can opt to input their food manually.</p>
  <p>What I need to do: I am working with SQLite to store the nutrient information for each meal so the user will be able to choose whether they want the food they ate to be saved to their daily intake and give the user a summation of their nutrient information for the day.</p>
