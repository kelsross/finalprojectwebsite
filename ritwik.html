<p>Week 4/17: What I did: Created splash page and planned general design and workflow for the app.</p>
  <p>What still needs to be done: Need to setup the firebase database and start working on authentication</p>
  <p>Week 4/24: What I did: Integrated firebase authentication. Created firebase database and reorganized code and made it more generalizable so it was simple to push to firebase from multiple places in the app. Created firebase hierarchy so that it was easy to pull user intake information and a database interface so that other classes wouldnâ€™t have to worry about having to manage firebase.</p>
  <p>What I need to do: Need to fix bugs occuring when authentication is done on different emulators and the app is sent to the phone through different laptops. I also need to integrate pulling from firebase</p>
  <p>Final Stage: What I did: Fixed bugs with firebase authentication and integrated pulling from the database in order to form daily intake graphs. Reorganized code so classes could be found more easily and deleted redundant code. Got some friends to test the app.</p>
