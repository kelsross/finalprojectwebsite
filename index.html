  <h3>What is it?</h3>
  <p>Our group is creating an application that will allow users to take pictures of the food they are eating and retrieve nutrition facts about the food. Overall, the purpose of our app will be nutrition based. Users will also be able to type in a foods name to get the nutritional information and use their GPS to find a local restaurant (mostly geered to Duke students so a Duke restaurant) where they can get that particular food. Additionally, our app will include links to podcasts pertaining to nutrition that will be linked to the internet that users will be able to stream through our app. Finally, the app will log dietary information for the users as they choose their meals throughout the day.</p>
  <p>How we plan to do it all:</p>
  <li>Using Googleâ€™s image search function to retrieve tags and identify foods in order to retrieve and return nutrition information to the user</li>
  <li>Using the GPS function to tag where photos were taken</li>
  <li>Allowing the user to listen to podcasts relating to health and nutrition</li>
  <li>Using Firebase for user authentication </li>
  <li>Using a Nutrition API in order to return nutrition information based on the image uploaded for the user</li>
