  <h4>What is it?</h4>
  <p>Our group is creating an application that will allow users to take pictures of the food they are eating and retrieve nutrition facts about the food. Overall, the purpose of our app will be nutrition based. Users will also be able to type in a foods name to get the nutritional information. The user will also be able to take photos of their food and the photo will be tagged and logged with the location the photo was taken in (for instance, if you are having a great meal at a particular resteraunt). Additionally, our app will include links to internet podcasts pertaining to nutrition users will be able to stream and listen to. Finally, the app will log dietary information for the users as they choose their meals throughout the day.</p>
  <h4>How we plan to do it all:</h4>
  <p>
  <li>Using Googleâ€™s image search function to retrieve tags and identify foods in order to retrieve and return nutrition information to the user</li>
  <li>Using the GPS function to tag where photos were taken and log them along with the photos as a kind of food-picture diary</li>
  <li>Allow the user to listen to podcasts relating to health and nutrition</li>
  <li>Using Firebase for user authentication and notifications to the user</li>
  <li>We will use both Computer Vision API and Edamam API in order to return nutrition information based on the image uploaded for the user</li>
  <li>Allow the user to type in the name of a food and return the nutrition information in the absence of a photo</li>
  <li>Using SQLite to store data for exchange across runs of the app</li>
