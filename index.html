  <h4>What is it?</h4>
  <p>Our group is creating an application that will allow users to take pictures of the food they are eating and retrieve nutrition facts about the food. Overall, the purpose of our app will be nutrition based. Users will also be able to type in a foods name to get the nutritional information. The user will also be able to take photos of their food and the photo will be tagged and logged with the location the photo was taken in (for instance, if you are having a great meal at a particular resteraunt). Additionally, our app will include links to internet podcasts pertaining to nutrition users will be able to stream and listen to. Finally, the app will log dietary information for the users as they choose their meals throughout the day.</p>
  <h4>How we did it all:</h4>
  <p>
  <li>Using Googleâ€™s reverse image search function we pulled tags to identify foods in order to retrieve and return nutrition information to the user</li>
    <li>The user is able to select which tags best match the food they are eating along with portion sizes to specify their food intake.</li>
  <li>In addition to typing and taking pictures of their food to return nutrient information, the user is able to say what they are eating which then is converted into text to return nutrient information.</li>
  <li>Firebase is used for both user authentication and as a database to save previous foods.</li>
  <li>We used both Computer Vision API and Edamam API in order to return nutrition information based on an uploaded image and text given by a user</li>
  <li>The user is able to type in the name of a food or say it in order to return the nutrition information in the absence of a photo</li>
    <li>Pie graphs display the user's progress toward their daily goals based on the foods they have stored to the database.</li>
