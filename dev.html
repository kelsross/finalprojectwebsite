    <p>For this application we primarily used the <href src="https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api"><a>Edamam API</a></href> which allows you to search their database for pre-packaged foods. We also utilized the Google Cloud Vision API in order to assit our reverse image searches of food to return tags for the user to determine which best fits the food they were eating. Voice detection was used in order to convert audio into text to search for nutrient information.</p>
    <p>Nothing is required for download in order to run this app, however, changing the URL in the EdamamActivity to include a developer's personal keycode will allow them to track their API queries on their own account.</p>
    <p>Firebase is used for user authentication in addition to using it as a database to store previous food intake.</p>
    <p>The app was tested using print statements, extensive logging and user testing (as in, allowing friends to beta test the app in order to exploit possible bugs). User testing was extremely beneficial in uderstanding what needed to be more clear in our user documentation and finding what parts of the app needed to be better adapted for UX.</p>
